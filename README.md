Hexfiles for flashing a Niu Mini atmega32u4 40% Planck MIT Layout compatible keyboard with qmk firmware.

The keyboard layout can be found in the forked qmk_firmware repo under niu_mini:grass_*_dvorak

The keylayout can visually be found here: http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/ca307f3027b2c0c4cded35309b3d4325 (Might not be entirely updated).

If anyone wants to use these hexfiles the latest version is the safest bet. The first 5 versions are broken to some extent.
